# DSC180 Project 2 - Community Detection with Machine Learning
## Explore Community Detection with Machine Learning
#### Yaoxin Li, Justin Nguyen, Vivek Rayalu

### Introduction
For this project, we explore the community detection solutions with machine learning, deep learning in particular. 

This repository contains all code for all findings and attempt related to this project.

### Run
To run the project, we left the test with `run.py`. However, since this project is  more about to explore the solutions for community detection, the content is relatively mass. It is really difficult to re-run all analysis, model training, and algorithms implemented in a short period of time. Therefore, in `test` of `run.py`, it will run our naive traditional community detection algorithm which depends on the number of common neighbors on the test dataset. It will make sure the graph related things can successful run.

Instead of letting our result and presenting our result in `run.py`, we choose notebooks to show the results and process. Specifically `/notebooks` folder contains all attempts and models we build and run.
